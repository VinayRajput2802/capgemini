Hello I am Vinay Kumar.
Exercise 1: Write a program to do the following operations using Thread:
•	Create an user defined Thread class called as “CopyDataThread .java” .
•	This class will be designed to copy the content from one file “source.txt ” to another file “target.txt” and after every 10 characters copied,   “10 characters are copied” message  will be shown to user.(Keep delay of 5 seconds after every 10 characters  read.)
•	Create another class “FileProgram.java” which will create above thread. Pass required File Stream classes to  CopyDataThread constructor and implement the above functionality.

Exercise 2:  Write a thread program to display timer where timer will get refresh after every 10seconds.( Use Runnable implementation )
